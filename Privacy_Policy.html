                <h4 id="id-5-who-do-we-share-your-personal-data-with"><strong>5. Who do we SHARE your personal data with?</strong></h4>
                <p>We may share your data with other affiliate companies in or outside Europe. We may also share your data with third parties, to help manage our business and deliver services. These third parties may from time to time need to have access to your personal data. These third parties may include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><em><strong>Service providers or partners</strong>, who perform functions on our behalf such as fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments, and providing customer services or other activities as necessary part of the functioning in our product or service.

                <p>Also, if we were to sell part of our businesses or assets, as required by applicable laws or agreed with relevant parties, we would need to transfer your personal data to the purchaser in case of carrying out relevant deals such as merger, acquisition or asset transfers.</p>
                <h4 id="id-6-direct-marketing"><strong>6. Direct marketing</strong></h4>
                <p>We may use your personal data to send you direct marketing communications about our own or third party products and services or our related services including our latest product announcements and upcoming events. This may be in the form of email, post, SMS, telephone or targeted online advertisements. We limit direct marketing to a reasonable and proportionate level, and to send you communications which we think will be interesting and relevant to you, based on the information we have about you.</p>
                <p>For the purposes of GDPR our processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes is based on our legitimate interests (as further detailed in applicable Appendix), but where opt-in consent is required by the relevant laws such as the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations of Europe, we may ask you for your consent. You have a right to stop receiving direct marketing at any time. You can do this by following the opt-out or unsubscribe links in electronic communications (such as emails), or by contacting us using the details in Section 12 if you find problems in making such settings by yourself. Please also note that, when necessary (e.g., certain service is suspended due to system maintenance), we may send to you relevant announcements. You may not be able to cancel the announcements related to the services that are not promotional in nature.</p>
                <p>We also use your personal data for customizing or personalizing ads, offers and content made available to you based on your usage of our mobile applications, websites, platforms or services, and analyzing the performance of those ads, offers and content, as well as your interaction with them. We may also recommend content to you based on information we have collected about you and your viewing habits. This constitutes “profiling” in respect of which more information is provided at Section 8 of this Policy.</p>
                <h4 id="id-7-international-transfers"><strong>7. International transfers</strong></h4>
                <p>We may transfer your personal data to affiliate companies or service providers that are located inside or outside of Europe. We may also share your personal data overseas, for example if we receive a legal or regulatory request from a foreign law enforcement body. We will always take steps to ensure that any international transfer of information is carefully managed to protect your rights and interests:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>we will only transfer your personal data to countries which are recognized as providing an adequate level of legal protection; and</li>
                    <li>transfers to affiliate companies, service providers and other third parties will always be protected by contractual commitments for additional security. For example, the EU–US Privacy Shield for the protection of personal data transferred to the US.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You have the right – as allowed under applicable law – to ask us for more information about the safeguards we have put in place as mentioned above. Contact us as set out in Section 12 if you would like further information (which may be redacted to ensure confidentiality).</p>
                <h4 id="id-8-profiling"><strong>8. Profiling</strong></h4>
                <p><strong>“Automated decision making”</strong> refers to a decision which is taken though the automated processing of your personal data alone. This means processing using, for example, software code or an algorithm, which does not involve any human intervention. As profiling uses automated processing, it is sometimes connected with automated decision making. Not all profiling results in automated decision making, but it can do.</p>
                <p>If you are a consumer that has signed up to receive marketing updates, we may use profiling to ensure that marketing materials are tailored to your preferences and to what we think you will be interested in. This does not have any significant effect, or a legal effect on you. In certain circumstances it may be possible to infer certain information about you from the result of profiling, which may include special categories of data. We will not however conduct profiling based on your special categories of data unless we have obtained your explicit consent to do so.</p>
                <p><strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> You have certain rights in respect of automated decision making, including profiling where that decision has significant effects on you, including where it produces a legal effect on you. See Section 10.</p>
                <h4 id="id-9-how-long-do-we-keep-your-personal-data"><strong>9. How long do we keep your personal data?</strong></h4>
                <p>We will retain your personal data for as long as is reasonably necessary for the purposes listed in Section 4 and relevant Appendixes of this Policy. In some circumstances we may retain your personal data for longer periods of time, for example where we are required to do so to meet legal, regulatory, tax or accounting requirements.</p>
                <p>In specific circumstances we may also retain your personal data for longer periods of time so that we have an accurate record of your dealings with us in the event of any complaints or challenges, or if we reasonably believe there is a possibility of legal action relating to your personal data or dealings. Where your personal data is no longer required we will ensure it is either securely deleted or stored in a way which means it will no longer be used by the business.</p>
                <h4 id="id-10-what-are-your-rights"><strong>10. What are your rights?</strong></h4>
                <p>You have a number of rights in relation to your personal data. In summary, you may request access to your data, rectification of any mistakes in our files, erasure of records where no longer required, restriction on the processing of your data, objection to the processing of your data, data portability and various information in relation to any automated decision making and profiling or the basis for international transfers. You also have the right to complain to your supervisory authority (further details of which are set out in Section 12 below).</p>
                <p>Those underlined are defined in more detail as follows:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><strong><em>Access</em></strong></p>
                    <p>You can ask us to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>confirm whether we are processing your personal data;</li>
                        <li>give you a copy of that data;</li>
                        <li>provide you with other information about your personal data such as what data we have, what we use it for, who we disclose it to, whether we transfer it abroad and how we protect it, how long we keep it for, what rights you have, how you can make a complaint, where we got your data from and whether we have carried out automated decision making or profiling, to the extent that information has not already been provided to you in this Policy.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong><em>Rectification</em></strong></p>
                    <p>You can ask us to rectify inaccurate personal data. We may seek to verify the accuracy of the data before rectifying it.</p>
                    <p><strong><em>Erasure</em></strong></p>
                    <p>You can ask us to erase your personal data, but only where:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>it is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collected; or</li>
                        <li>you have withdrawn your consent (where the data processing was based on consent); or</li>
                        <li>following a successful right to object (see “objection” below); or</li>
                        <li>it has been processed unlawfully; or</li>
                        <li>to comply with a legal obligation which it is subject to.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We are not required to comply with your request to erase your personal data if the processing of your personal data is necessary: for compliance with a legal obligation; or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims. There are certain other circumstances in which we are not required to comply with your erasure request, although these two are the most likely circumstances where we would deny that request.</p>
                    <p><strong><em>Restriction</em></strong></p>
                    <p>You can ask us to restrict (i.e. keep but not use) your personal data, but only where:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>its accuracy is contested (see “rectification” below), to allow us to verify its accuracy; or</li>
                        <li>the processing is unlawful, but you do not want it erased; or</li>
                        <li>it is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collected, but we still need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or</li>
                        <li>you have exercised the right to object, and verification of overriding grounds is pending.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We can continue to use your personal data following a request for restriction, where:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>we have your consent; or</li>
                        <li>to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or</li>
                        <li>to protect the rights of another natural or legal person.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong><em>Portability</em></strong></p>
                    <p>You can ask us to provide your personal data to you in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format, or you can ask to have it “ported” directly to another data controller, but in each case only where: the processing is based on your consent or the performance of a contract with you; and the processing is carried out by automated means.</p>
                    <p><strong><em>Objection</em></strong></p>
                    <p>You can object to any processing of your personal data which has our legitimate interests as its legal basis (see Section 4 or contact us for further details), if you believe your fundamental rights and freedoms outweigh our legitimate interests. Once you have objected, we have an opportunity to demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate interests which override your rights.</p>
                    <p><strong><em>Automated Decision Making</em></strong></p>
                    <p>You can ask not to be subject to a decision which is based solely on automated processing (see Section 8), but only where that decision:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>produces legal effects concerning you (such as the rejection of a claim); or</li>
                        <li>otherwise significantly affects you.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In such situations, you can obtain human intervention in the decision making, and we will ensure measures are in place to allow you to express your point of view, and / or contest the automated decision. Your right to obtain human intervention or to contest a decision does not apply where the decision which is made following automated decision making:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>is necessary for entering into or performing a contract with you;</li>
                        <li>is authorized by law and there are suitable safeguards for your rights and freedoms; or</li>
                        <li>is based on your explicit consent.</li>
                    </ul>
                </blockquote>
                <p>To exercise your rights you may contact us as set out in Section 12. Please note the following if you do wish to exercise these rights:</p>
                <ul>
